    <p style="color:  #ffa500;"><b>Learn about the thrilling sport of death diving.</b></p>
    <p style="color: #ff6fff"><b>Death diving, also known as "dødsing" in Norwegian, is an extreme sport and a unique form <br>of cliff diving that involves participants jumping from great heights into the water while<br> maintaining a straight, rigid posture.<br>The goal is to enter the water vertically with minimal splashing,<br> making it both visually stunning and physically challenging. This sport is known for its daredevil nature, <br>as participants often dive from considerable heights, making it a thrilling and adrenaline-pumping activity.</b></p>
    <p style="color: #ff6fff"><b>In death diving, the diver starts from a high platform, usually a cliff or diving board, and begins<br>by standing upright with arms extended straight above the head.<br>They then leap into the water, trying to maintain a perfectly straight and rigid posture throughout<br>the entire descent. The key elements of a successful death dive are:</b></p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li style="color: #ff6fff"><b>A straight and stiff body: Divers must keep their body straight with legs close together and toes pointed.</b></li>
        <li style="color: #ff6fff"><b>Minimal splashing: The goal is to enter the water with as little splashing as possible. <br>This requires precise timing and coordination.</b></li>
        <li style="color: #ff6fff"><b>High platforms: Death diving is often performed from heights of 10 meters (33 feet) or more,<br>adding an extra layer of danger and excitement.</b></li>
        </ol>
    <p style="color: #ff6fff"><b>Participants in death diving competitions are judged on the creativity and difficulty of their jumps,<br>as well as their style and the splash they create when entering the water.<br>It is important to note that death diving can be extremely dangerous and<br>is not recommended for inexperienced divers.<br>The term "death diving" is a nod to the risk involved in performing such high-risk stunts.</b></p>
    <p style="color: #ff6fff"><b>This activity is often associated with Norway and has gained popularity in Scandinavian countries,<br>particularly during summer events and festivals.<br>Participants usually wear colorful and<br>eccentric costumes to add an element of fun and showmanship to their dives.</b></p>
    <p style="color: #ff6fff"><b>While death diving can be thrilling to watch and participate in for those<br>with the necessary skills and experience,<br>it carries inherent risks, including the potential for serious injuries<br>if dives are not executed properly. Therefore,<br>safety precautions, proper training, and supervision are<br>crucial for anyone attempting death dives.</b></p>

                    <li style="font-weight: bold; color: #74fc0c;">As you descend, tuck your chin slightly toward your chest to<br>maintain a straight line from your head to your toes.</li>
